### My name is Vilén, Timo Vilén.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: [Launch code for US nukes was 00000000 (eight 0’s). Is that for real? Well, yes, so we should feel that we were lucky enough that no “terrorist” did try launching the nuclear missiles,  one of the interesting technology facts you will not find anywhere on the Internet.](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/12/launch-code-for-us-nukes-was-00000000-for-20-years/)
