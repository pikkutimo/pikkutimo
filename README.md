Although inventor Thomas Edison had used the word “bug” to describe a technical error in 1878, Grace Hopper in 1947 made the term popular when she noted “debugging” the system after removing the moth. ](https://www.ucode.com/python-coding-classes-for-kids-free-class/fun-facts-about-computer-programming)
